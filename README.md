# StudPal

StudPal is an intelligent chatbot designed to help students with their studies. It answers academic questions, explains concepts, and generates helpful text responses based on your prompts.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Gradio (web interface)
- Google FLAN-T5 model (LLM)
- **Haystack** (being progressively integrated for Retrieval-Augmented Generation, to improve answer quality)

## Features

- Answers academic questions using AI
- Generates text responses from user prompts
- Simple, user-friendly web interface
- Fast and accurate responses powered by Google FLAN-T5
- Adjustable temperature for creative or precise answers
- **Upcoming:** Enhanced answers using Haystack and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

## Usage

Just type your question or prompt in the input box and click "Submit." StudPal will generate an answer for you!

## Progress

I'm currently adding Haystack to the codebase to enable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This will allow StudPal to provide even more accurate and context-aware answers by retrieving relevant information before generating responses.
